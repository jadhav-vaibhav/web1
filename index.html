     <h1>Self-motivation tips</h1>
     Let's take a closer look at each of the above tips. Here, 
     we'll break down these self-motivation techniques, 
     detailing what they are and the science behind them.
        <h1>1. Put your goal on the calendar</h1><p>
            One way to give a boost to your internal motivation is to create some external 
            motivation:a target date. Whatever it is you’re aiming to accomplish, put it on 
            the calendar. You may be working toward a goal with a set finish date built in. 
            Examples include preparing for a test or taking a course with a fixed end date. 
            If your goal lacks this structure, you can add it by deciding on a date by which 
            you could realistically achieve your goal. Want to run a 5k or marathon? Sign up 
            for a race on or near your target date. Considering a degree? Research the 
            application deadline and write it down. Aiming to learn a new career skill? 
            Register for a course and set a target date to finish.Having a target date not only 
            helps you stay motivated, it also helps you track your progress—you always know how 
            much further you have to go. This can have a big impact on your performance
        </p>
        <h1>2. Make Working toward your goal a habit</h1><p>When you make working toward your goal 
            a habit—an automatic conditioned response—you no longer have to rely so much on 
            feeling motivated. How do you turn a behavior into a habit?</p><h3>Identify a trigger</h3>
            <p>Choose something that you already do everyday, like brushing your teeth or eating
                lunch, to be a trigger for the action you want to make a habit. Write out an 
                “if-then” plan (also known as an implementation intention).For example, if
                 you want to create a habit of studying for a class everyday, your if-then 
                 plan might look like this:</p>
